## My process

### Built with

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Dev Server
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - React State Manager
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I delved into the realm of redux-persist, a valuable tool for managing state in applications. I gained hands-on experience in effectively storing state data within browser storage. My work included creating a user-friendly mobile interface, implementing the core game logic, and managing the state intricacies. To enhance accessibility, I also made the website responsive to accommodate larger screens. While the project didn't introduce entirely novel concepts, it provided a fruitful platform for me to practice and refine my existing skills.

### Continued development

Embarking on my second project within this platform proved to be a more demanding endeavor compared to my initial experience. Despite the increased complexity that consumed additional time, the final outcome justified every moment invested. Engaging with projects of this nature significantly contributes to boosting my self-assurance and igniting a heightened sense of motivation as I forge ahead along my roadmap.
